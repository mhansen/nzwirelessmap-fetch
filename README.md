# nzwirelessmap-fetch

This project fetched updates from New Zealand's Radio Spectrum Management
database of radio spectrum licenses.

We converted the Microsoft Access file to SQLite then JSON, saved the data into
Cloud Storage.

The system this fetched, "Spectrum Search Lite" was discontinued in December
2022, without a bulk replacement. So there is no more data to fetch, and this
is archived.
